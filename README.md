Project: Recipes
This project is a website that lists some recipes along with their ingredients.

I will learn how to add HTML into my page structure and include some basic CSS.




Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.
Example:

 <ul>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 3</a></li>
  </ul>
Your links won’t be flashy, but for now just focus on building them out.
