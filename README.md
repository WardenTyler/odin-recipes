Project: Recipes
This project is a website that lists some recipes along with their ingredients.

I will learn how to add HTML into my page structure and include some basic CSS.

This project tought me how to create proper links. I had an issue where I couldn't link to certain pages and had to discover why those links weren't working. It turns out I had a slash added in the directory link when it wasn't required. 

I also learn't a lot about page structure and header numbers.
