                <p>By now, everyone has probably had at least one smash burger before—whether that be a homemade one or even one of the famous restaurant chain’s burgers. But, while most people associate the trendy smash burger with In-N-Out, it’s been around for much longer than the West Coast hot spot has been flipping burgers.</p>
                <p>The Oklahoma Fried Onion Burger is one of the “oldest, classic burgers in the world,” according to Cailan. It was created in Oklahoma (obviously) during the Great Depression when meat was expensive but onions were cheap—so making smash burgers meant they could use less of the expensive meat and more of the cheap veggie.</p>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add butter and oil; heat until butter is melted. Add onion and garlic. Cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, divide ground meat into 4 portions and shape into patties. Season with salt and seasoning.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or flat-top over medium-high heat for a few minutes. Place patties into the hot skillet and smash with a spatula or bacon press. Hold patties down for 30 seconds, then cover each patty with some of the cooked onion. Cook for 2 minutes. Carefully flip burgers, making sure to scrape the browned bits off the skillet.</li>
            <li>Press down on the flipped patties to sink the onions into the meat.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add sliced mushrooms to the skillet used for the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season patties with salt and pepper and place a slice of cheese on each. Cook until burgers have reached the desired doneness, 2 to 4 minutes more. Top each patty with leftover onion and mushrooms and serve on buns.</li>
        </ol>
